Generating all possible triplets would result in many
triplets that are easily satisfied (i.e. fulfill the constraint
in Eq. (1)). These triplets would not contribute to the training
and result in slower convergence, as they would still

be passed through the network. It is crucial to select hard
triplets, that are active and can therefore contribute to improving
the model. The following section talks
